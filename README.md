## hotdognothotdog: Developed by Roshan Noronha 
###### **With help from friends and the internet**

### The goal of this project is to train a network to accurately determine if an object is a hotdog or not. This project will be done in 4 stages.

##### 1) Implementing a basic CNN from scratch that can recognize dogs and cats. The dataset is fairly large so this should not be a limitation. This simple example should provide insight into what is needed to properly implement hotdognothotdog. The code for this step is in the "dogsandcats" folder.

##### 2) From the network in 1) the accuracy was low. In this step transfer learning will be used to increase the accuracy of the CNN. This network will still recognize dogs and cats. The code for this step is in the "transferlearning-dogsandcats" folder.

##### 3) TBA

##### 4) TBA
