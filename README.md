## hotdognothotdog: Developed by Roshan Noronha*
###### *With help from friends and the internet

### The goal of this project is to train a network to accurately determine if an object is a hotdog or not. Google Colab was used to run and train this model via a Jupyter notebook. This project will be done in 4 stages.

##### 1) Implementing a basic CNN from scratch that can recognize dogs and cats. The dataset is fairly large so this should not be a limitation. This simple example should provide insight into what is needed to properly implement hotdognothotdog. The code for this step is in the "dogsandcats" folder. (COMPLETED)

##### 2) From the network in 1) the accuracy was low. In this step transfer learning will be used to increase the accuracy of the CNN. This network will still recognize dogs and cats. The code for this step is in the "transferlearning-dogsandcats" folder. (IN PROGRESS)

##### 3) Using what was learnt in steps 1) and 2) a hot dog dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/hot-dog-not-hot-dog/home) will be used instead of dogs and cats. (NOT STARTED)

##### 4) Implement some kind of app so that people can feed the network their own images and get a reply. (NOT STARTED)
